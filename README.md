Hi, I don't feel any interest anymore when I create malware. I no longer feel any interest in creating projects for it to be stolen by pitiful skids.

I would like to apologize to all the people who had problems with Lithium Grabber or with me personally.

All good adventures come to an end.

Thank you for everything
